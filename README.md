JAX-RS implementation of a collaborative interactive story. This is intended as a replacement to the current 
engine at https://fictionbranches.net/

Fiction Branches is an online software engine which allows the production of multi-plotted stories. Each story 
is divided into episodes comprising a single page of text. Each page will have a title, a link back to the 
parent episode and the story text for that episode. At the end of each episode there can be one or more links 
to subsequent episodes, plus the option to add another branch to the story at that point.
